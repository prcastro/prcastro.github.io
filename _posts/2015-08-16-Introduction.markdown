Hi everyone,

My name is Paulo, I am a undergrad student at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, and I'm starting a blog. The main goal with this is to organize my ideas and present what I learn in the University (and on the internet) in a way that is as simple to understand as possible.

The first thing you'll probably notice is that I edit my posts a lot. This is because I always find details that I want to enhance, but also because I'm not a native english speaker (resulting in several typos and grammatical errors that I will try to correct).

The main subjects I will talk in this blog are Machine Learning, Programming, Probability, Bayesian Inference, Information Theory, Statistical Physics, Neuroscience, Bioinformatics and Evolution. Notice that I still haven't decided what major area I will specialize in the future, so I'll simply explore these and extract as much as I can from each of them. As we progress, I'll naturally find out my main interests and this will be reflected in this blog.

Of course, I'll preserve my interests in things other than science and eventually talk about politics in my country, cinema, television or music as well.

Welcome to my journey,

Paulo Roberto de Oliveira Castro
